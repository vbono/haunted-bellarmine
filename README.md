# haunted-bellarmine

Welcome! This is a semester long project done in CPSC 2231L Programming Workshop Lab at Fairfield University in a group of 2.

The goal of this project was to create a text-based adventure game, similar to Colossal Cave Adventure created by Will Crowther & Don Woods in 1976.
(see game here: https://grack.com/demos/adventure/)

This game is set on Fairfield University's campus in the landmark Bellarmine Mansion.

Players traverse through the map of the mansion, collecting items and uncovering hidden secrets which lead them closer to the final battle to win the game.

Enjoy!
